# HyperEstimator

## Introduction
HyperEstimator is an approach using [Grammatical Evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_evolution) (GE), a grammar based evolutionary algorithm, Linear Regression and Bayesian Optimisation to tune the hyperparameters for a Convolutional Neural Networks, using a sample of 5% of the dataset. 

HyperEstimator is implemented using [PonyGE2](https://github.com/PonyGE/PonyGE2), and python libraries. For more details on PonyGE2, please visit the official documentation of [PonyGE2](https://github.com/PonyGE/PonyGE2).

The approach HyperEstimator is published in [ICSBT 2022](https://icsbt.scitevents.org/), and available [online](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362055158_HyperEstimator_Evolving_Computationally_Efficient_CNN_Models_with_Grammatical_Evolution). The steps to implement HyperEstimator or recreating methods and results for the paper can be referred from [Wiki](https://github.com/gauriivaidya/HyperEstimator/wiki). The work is published in collaboration with Luise Ilg, Meghana Kshirsagar, Enrique Naredo and Conor Ryan at [Biocomputing and Developmental Systems Group](www.bds.ul.ie) at [University of Limerick, Ireland](www.ul.ie).
